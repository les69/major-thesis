\begin{abstract}

The recent increase of power of computation combined to the decrease of power
consumption of devices led to an explosion of smart devices for all the possible
purposes, and it's called the \textit{Internet of Things} (IoT).\\
The IoT includes all devices that has an interface to the real world
and are connected to the Internet, such as: \textit{Smart Fridges, Smart TVs, Thermostats,
Alarms, Cameras and etc}. These devices were born to simplify normal people's life,
let's take the smart fridge as example: it will alert you when the food you have in the
fridge is going to expire, the thermostat will try to save money applying smart
strategies for heat consumption. One of the most important application of IoT
to people's life is \textit{House Security}: exploiting the IoT concept to improve the house
security with smart sensors like cameras, leap motion sensors and microphones.
House Security has to be of concern, because house invasion is an always trending
crime. However these systems are not always perfect and the most common problem are
false positives, for the which there is an active branch of research focused on.\\
The emergence of devices connected introduced another problem: heterogeneity between
IoT devices. As the popularity of smart devices increased more and more companies
started producing their own different ecosystems. Communication between different
ecosystems is another research topic which will analyzed in this document.
